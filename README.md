This is the code that I used for my tutorial, Getting Started With Flask, published on Scotch.io.

It is a beginner tutorial that covers:

Installation of Flask and its prerequisites
Recommended file and directory structure for a Flask project
Configuration and initialization of a Flask app
Creating views and templates
